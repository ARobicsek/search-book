I'm building **SearchBook**, a lightweight local CRM for managing my executive job search networking.

**Before doing anything, read these files:**
- `.planning/STATE.md` — Session history and decisions
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — All phases and acceptance criteria

**GSD methodology.** Atomic commits per task.

## Phase 7: iPhone PWA Access — COMPLETE

**App is live:** https://searchbook-three.vercel.app

### Deployment details:
- **Database:** Turso cloud (libsql://searchbook-arobicsek.aws-us-east-2.turso.io)
- **Photo storage:** Vercel Blob (configured)
- **Environment variables:** Set in Vercel dashboard

## What Was Completed Last Session

### Bug Fixes (3 items)

1. **Fixed Vercel Deployment Error** — Resolved TypeScript errors in `contact-form.tsx` regarding `companyId` properties that were blocking the build.

2. **Fixed New Company Creation in Edit Mode** — The "Done" button in Edit mode was incorrectly navigating away before the form could submit. Changed it to trigger a proper form submission (with explicit `onClick` handling), ensuring new company entries are validated, created, and linked before navigation.

3. **Fixed "People Discussed" Bug** — Updated `contact-detail.tsx` to correctly handle new contact creation from the "People Discussed" field in the Conversation Log. The `MultiCombobox` selection now correctly triggers the backend to create a new contact when a new name is entered.

### Cleanup
- Removed temporary debug logs from `contact-form.tsx` after verifying the fix.


## Running Locally
```bash
npm start
```
- **Client**: http://localhost:5173
- **Server**: http://localhost:3001

**Important:** `server/.env` must have Turso credentials **commented out** for local development:
```
# TURSO_DATABASE_URL="libsql://..."
# TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
```
If these are uncommented, the app will try to connect to Turso cloud DB and hang indefinitely.

If Prisma errors: `cd server && npx prisma generate`

## Production Deployment

**Auto-deploys on push to main** — Vercel is connected to GitHub.

**Before pushing, always run:**
```bash
npm run prepush
```
This catches TypeScript errors and missing files before they break the Vercel build.

Then push:
```bash
git push
```

To set environment variables (use printf to avoid newlines):
```bash
printf 'value' | vercel env add VAR_NAME production
```

## Technical Notes

1. **Turso CLI on Windows requires WSL** — Use web dashboard instead
2. **@libsql/client versions** — Server: 0.5.6 (downgraded for Prisma adapter compatibility). Client: 0.17.0 (browser-direct via `/web` export)
3. **Vercel env vars** — Use `printf` not heredoc to avoid trailing newlines that break URLs/tokens
4. **build:vercel script** — Must install client and server dependencies before build
5. **Photos in production** — Only Vercel Blob URLs work; local `/photos/` paths are dev-only
6. **Overdue timezone** — Server accepts `today` query param from client to fix timezone issues
7. **Auto-save pattern** — `useAutoSave` hook in `client/src/hooks/use-auto-save.ts` handles debounced saves
8. **Contacts pagination** — Server returns `{ data: [...], pagination: { total, limit, offset, hasMore } }`
9. **Server-side filters** — `/contacts` accepts `ecosystem`, `status`, `flagged`, `search` query params
10. **Server-side sorting** — `/contacts` accepts `sortBy=lastOutreachDate` + `sortDir=asc|desc` for cross-page sort
11. **Duplicate detection** — Normalizes names (strips middle initials, suffixes) before Levenshtein; inverted-index candidate generation (name tokens + email); OR logic (similar name OR same email); slim DB query; merge dialog lazy-loads full details on demand
12. **Client timeout** — `TIMEOUT_MS = 30000` in `client/src/lib/api.ts`; Vercel `maxDuration: 30` in `vercel.json`
13. **Vercel 30s timeout** — Hobby plan max. Browser-direct Turso access bypasses this for backup/restore.
14. **Browser-direct Turso** — `@libsql/client/web` in client connects to Turso over HTTPS. The `/web` export auto-converts `libsql://` URLs to `https://`. Used for backup export and restore to avoid Vercel timeout.
15. **Backup security** — Turso auth token is exposed to browser via `/api/backup/credentials`. Acceptable for personal single-user app. Can create read-only token later for hardening.
16. **Express body limit** — Increased to 50MB (`express.json({ limit: '50mb' })` in `app.ts`) for backup import payloads.
17. **Backup date formats** — Turso returns dates as Unix ms timestamps, ISO strings, or raw SQLite strings. `toDate()` in `backup.ts` handles all three.
18. **Production backup workflow** — JSON downloads to browser; user manually copies to `SearchBook/backups/` (amber UI reminder). Save-local endpoint only works in local dev (Vercel has read-only filesystem).
19. **Turso schema migrations** — Prisma `db push` only works against local SQLite. For Turso production, run DDL directly: temporarily uncomment Turso creds in `server/.env`, use `node -e "require('dotenv').config(); const { createClient } = require('@libsql/client'); ..."` to execute CREATE TABLE statements, then re-comment creds.
20. **Multi-select actions** — Actions support 0-N contacts and companies via `ActionContact`/`ActionCompany` junction tables. Legacy single `contactId`/`companyId` fields preserved for backward compatibility. All views (form, detail, list) fall back to legacy fields when junction tables are empty.
