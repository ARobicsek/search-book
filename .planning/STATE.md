(2) Conversation notes field — increased rows from 3 to 6, dialog widened to max-w-xl. (3) 500 error on contacts PUT — fixed by always deleting referredByName from payload before API call. (4) "How Connected" placeholder — changed to "How did you get connected?". (5) Mutual Connections — converted from Textarea to MultiCombobox with allowFreeText, stores as comma-separated string. **Phase 3 feedback round 3 complete.** |

(3) CSV import with column mapping (3-step wizard). (4) Tags CRUD (assign to contacts via badge UI). (5) Ideas full CRUD (list page, dialogs, search). Remaining: date range filter. **Phase 4 ~90% complete.** |
| 2026-02-04 | Phase 4 completed + Phase 5 started. (1) Date range filter for last outreach — server computes lastOutreachDate from most recent conversation, filter by date range with "include never contacted" option, added Last Outreach column to table. **Phase 4 complete.** (2) PWA support — vite-plugin-pwa with manifest, service worker (NetworkFirst for API, CacheFirst for photos), PWA update prompt component, generated placeholder icons. (3) Analytics dashboard — 6 API endpoints (overview, contacts/conversations over time, by ecosystem/status, actions completed), Recharts visualizations (bar/line/pie charts), period toggle (week/month), overview cards.

| 2026-02-04 | Phase 5 completed + feedback fixes. Feedback: (31) Fixed PWA manifest syntax error — added devOptions to VitePWA config. (32) Default company status to CONNECTED when auto-created from contact form. (33) Idea dialog prevents close on outside click. (34) Prep notes date label simplified to "Date". (35) Open Questions removed from contact detail (overview + prep sheet tabs). (36) Added missing shadcn checkbox component. Phase 5 remaining: (1) Recurring action automation — completing a recurring action auto-creates next occurrence with offset dueDate, respects recurringEndDate, toast notifications on all 5 completion call sites. (2) Contact flagging — flagged field on Contact, flag toggle column on contacts table, "Flagged" filter button, batch action toolbar with "Create Action for Flagged" dialog (title/type/priority/dueDate), flags auto-clear after batch creation. (3) Action history log — "Completed Date" column when Completed filter active, server-side sortBy=completedDate support. **Phase 5 complete.** |
| 2026-02-04 | Feedback items (#36-40) + Phase 6 completed. Feedback: (36) Default conversation type VIDEO_CALL. (37) MultiCombobox per-item Badge removal. (38) Ideas linked to contacts/companies via IdeaContact/IdeaCompany junction tables + MultiCombobox. (39) Prep notes shown in conversation dialog (two-column layout).

Phase 6: (1) One-click backup + restore (backup API, Settings page with create/restore). (2) Loading spinners (Loader2) on all pages. (3) Keyboard shortcuts dialog (? key, g+key navigation). (4) Duplicate detection + merge tool (Levenshtein similarity, merge transfers all relations). **Phase 6 complete.** |
| 2026-02-04 | Pre-Phase 7 fixes session. (1) Action form Combobox — replaced Select with searchable Combobox for Contact/Company fields with inline create. (2) Prep Notes yellow background — added bg-yellow-50 to note cards. (3) Prep Notes progressive disclosure — "+Add Prep Note" button expands to form. (4) Relationship modal Combobox — replaced Select with searchable Combobox + inline create. (5) Multiple companies refactor — replaced EmploymentHistory approach with simple additionalCompanyIds JSON array (like emails), add/remove UI with multiple Comboboxes. (6) Actions page search — added globalFilter search across title/description/contact/company. (7) Idea modal inline create — added allowFreeText to MultiCombobox for contacts/companies with auto-create on submit. Database path: `server/dev.db`. **Pre-Phase 7 fixes complete.** |
| 2026-02-05 | Phase 7 started: iPhone PWA Access via Vercel deployment. (1) Quick fix: company separator changed from comma to pipe. (2) Vercel config: created vercel.json with single serverless function approach (bypasses 12-function limit). (3) Express refactor: split into app.ts (exportable) and index.ts (local server). (4) iOS PWA meta tags: added apple-mobile-web-app-capable, status-bar-style, title. (5) Turso support: added @libsql/client and @prisma/adapter-libsql, updated db.ts for conditional Turso/SQLite. (6) Created api/index.ts for Vercel serverless handler. (7) Updated .gitignore for Vercel. Remaining: create Turso database, set up Vercel Blob for photos, deploy to Vercel, test on iPhone. **Phase 7 in progress.** |
| 2026-02-05 | Phase 7 continued + UI fixes. (1) Vercel Blob support — updated upload.ts to use @vercel/blob in production (BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN detection), multer memory storage for serverless. (2) Current/past company indicator — changed additionalCompanyIds from [id] to [{id, isCurrent}] format, "Past" checkbox in contact form, header shows only current companies, past companies shown with "formerly" styling. (3) Search includes past companies — contact list search now includes all company names. (4) Trash icon overflow fix — wrapped Combobox in flex-1 min-w-0 div. All code changes committed. Remaining: create Turso DB, deploy to Vercel, test iPhone PWA. **Phase 7 in progress.** |
| 2026-02-05 | Debug session: App hanging on dashboard. Root cause: `server/.env` had TURSO_DATABASE_URL uncommented, causing db.ts to connect to Turso cloud instead of local SQLite. Turso connection was hanging (not fully configured). Fix: commented out Turso credentials in .env for local dev. **Important:** Keep Turso credentials commented in .env for local development; set them only in Vercel dashboard for production. |
| 2026-02-05 | **Phase 7 deployment complete.** (1) Created Turso database via web dashboard (CLI requires WSL on Windows). (2) Wrote migration script to transfer data from local SQLite to Turso (downgraded @libsql/client to 0.5.6 to avoid migration jobs bug). (3) Fixed TypeScript errors blocking Vercel build (removed unused Legend import, fixed recharts tooltip types, fixed Field component className prop, made api.post data optional, added dueDate to Conversation.actions type). (4) Fixed Vercel build: added `npm install --prefix client && npm install --prefix server` to build:vercel script. (5) Deployed to Vercel, set TURSO_DATABASE_URL and TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN environment variables (must use `printf` not heredoc to avoid trailing newlines). (6) Blob storage auto-enabled. **App live at https://searchbook-three.vercel.app** with all data synced. **Phase 7 complete.** |
| 2026-02-05 | **Post-Phase 7 polish session.** Priority fixes: (1) Date precision in Last Outreach column — server returns `lastOutreachDatePrecision`, client formats as "January 2026" for MONTH, "2026" for YEAR. (2) Prep notes yellow background — changed `bg-muted/30` to `bg-yellow-50` in conversation dialog. (3) Photo display in production — prioritize `photoUrl` over `photoFile`, only show local paths in dev mode via `import.meta.env.DEV`. (4) SPA routing fix — added fallback rewrite in vercel.json for 404 on hard refresh. New features: (5) Document links for Actions — added `actionId` to Link model, links CRUD in action form/detail pages. (6) Links card for Companies — inline add/remove links on company detail page. (7) Default sort by updatedAt — contacts and companies tables now sort most recently updated first. (8) Phase 8 noted in roadmap — Google Drive document search for full-text search across linked documents. **Pending:** Run Turso migration `ALTER TABLE Link ADD COLUMN actionId INTEGER...` before deploying. |
| 2026-02-05 | **Production bug fixes session.** (1) Overdue timezone fix — Server now accepts `today` query param from client to determine overdue actions using user's local timezone instead of server UTC. Dashboard passes local date in API calls. (2) Photos not showing — Confirmed expected behavior: local `/photos/` paths don't work in production. Users must re-upload photos via production site to store them in Vercel Blob. |
| 2026-02-05 | **Mobile UI improvements session.** Comprehensive mobile fixes for iPhone 390px viewport: (1) Layout — reduced main padding to p-3 on mobile, hid Ctrl+K hint on mobile. (2) Dashboard — ActionRow stacks vertically with 44px touch targets. (3) List pages (contacts, companies, actions) — responsive headers/filter bars, column visibility hides non-essential columns on mobile via TanStack Table columnVisibility. (4) Detail pages — headers stack on mobile, scrollable tabs, responsive Edit/Delete buttons. (5) Forms — Save/Cancel buttons full-width on mobile. (6) Calendar — **BUG:** added listPlugin import but package not installed (needs `npm install @fullcalendar/list`). (7) Analytics — stat cards 2-column grid on mobile. (8) Ideas — larger touch targets for edit/delete buttons. **Next session:** Install missing @fullcalendar/list package, then deploy and test on iPhone. |
| 2026-02-06 | **PWA icon + calendar fix session.** (1) Installed @fullcalendar/list package — fixes calendar build error for mobile list view. (2) Created 1980s retro PWA icons (pink/purple gradient with book + magnifying glass) — later replaced with user's existing Windows 95 pixel-art "S" scroll icon (`SearchBook icon.png`). (3) Updated favicon to use pixel-art PNG instead of SVG for consistent branding across browser tabs, desktop shortcut, and mobile PWA. All changes committed and pushed. **Ready for Vercel deploy and iPhone testing. Next session: Phase 8 (Google Drive document search).** |
| 2026-02-06 | **UI fixes + Global Search session.** (1) Fixed scroll arrows on contact card tab bar — removed `overflow-x-auto` from TabsList. (2) Mutual connections auto-create — contacts entered in "Mutual Connections" field now auto-create with status=CONNECTED if name doesn't exist. (3) **Global Search feature** — new `/api/search` endpoint searching across contacts, companies, actions, ideas with related entities; new `/search` page with expandable result cards showing relationships; enhanced command palette with live search results (debounced 300ms); mobile search button in header (44px touch target, opens command palette). |
| 2026-02-06 | **Contact statuses + CSV import session.** (1) Add actions when editing conversations — removed `!editId` restriction, server PUT now creates actions. (2) Contact status updates — renamed WARM_LEAD→LEAD_TO_PURSUE, added RESEARCHING status. (3) Distinct status colors — contacts (slate/blue/green/yellow/orange/pink/gray/red), companies (sky/indigo/violet/emerald/gray/red). (4) Links in Contact profiles — Links card added to Overview tab with add/remove functionality. (5) Enhanced CSV import — supports firstName/lastName columns (auto-combines), auto-creates companies, creates links from linkUrl column, improved header aliases for auto-mapping (LinkedIn Profile, Mobile, City, etc.). |
| 2026-02-06 | **Auto-save extensions + Merge enhancements session.** (1) Auto-save for Ideas form — added useAutoSave hook (1.5s debounce) and SaveStatusIndicator to Ideas dialog in edit mode. (2) Auto-save for Conversation dialog — added useAutoSave hook (2s debounce) to Conversations dialog; actions/links NOT auto-saved. (3) Enhanced duplicate merge — added missing fields (mutualConnections, whereFound, openQuestions, photoUrl, photoFile, flagged). (4) "Keep Both" option for email — merge dialog now allows combining all emails from both contacts; backend deduplicates and stores first as primary, rest as additionalEmails. |
| 2026-02-07 | **Last Outreach fix + Duplicate detection + Links in edit form session.** (1) Fixed Last Outreach column — root cause was default sort (updatedAt desc) showing bulk-imported contacts (no conversations) on first pages; API data was correct but user never saw pages with outreach data. Added server-side `sortBy=lastOutreachDate` + `sortDir` params so clicking the column header sorts across ALL contacts (not just current page). Server fetches all contacts, computes lastOutreachDate, sorts with nulls last, then paginates. (2) Smarter duplicate detection — added `normalizeName()` to strip middle initials (M.), suffixes (J.D., Jr., PhD, etc.) before Levenshtein comparison. "Katie Tucker" vs "Katie M. Tucker" now scores 1.0 instead of 0.80. Also added compound signal: same company + name similarity >0.6 flags duplicates. (3) Links in contact edit form — added Links card to contact-form.tsx with inline add/remove (same pattern as detail page). Edit mode: loads existing links via API. Create mode: stores pending links locally, saves after contact creation. (4) CSV export includes links — export fetches all links, groups by contactId, adds "Links" column with pipe-separated entries. |
| 2026-02-07 | **Duplicate detection performance + Manual merge + Ctrl-K simplification session.** (1) Simplified Ctrl-K command palette — removed Quick Add, Navigate, Contacts, Companies sections; only Global Search remains on initial open; live search results still shown when typing. (2) Manual merge feature — added Combobox-based contact picker UI on duplicates page; select any two contacts and merge with field-by-field selection. (3) "Keep Both" for phone numbers — added phone to MULTI_VALUE_FIELDS; server combines with " | " separator. (4) Duplicate detection performance — multiple iterations to fix Vercel 30s timeout: (a) pre-computed normalized names/tokens, (b) rewrote to inverted-index candidate generation (name tokens + email), (c) removed company/LinkedIn indexes, (d) slimmed DB query to only id/name/email/title/company, (e) increased client timeout from 15s to 30s. (5) Lazy-load merge details — auto-detected and manual merge buttons now both fetch full contact details on demand (not bundled in list response), fixing type mismatch and reducing payload size. Detection uses OR logic: similar name OR same email. |
| 2026-02-08 | **Backup feature session (BLOCKED).** Attempted to make "Create Backup" work in production (Vercel + Turso). All approaches timed out on Vercel's 30s serverless limit: (1) Single endpoint with `$queryRawUnsafe` on `sqlite_master` + all table SELECTs. (2) Same with `Promise.all` parallelization. (3) Split into `/backup/schema` + `/backup/data/:tableName` per-table endpoints with client-side assembly. (4) Single endpoint using `prisma.*.findMany()` for all 16 models via `Promise.all`. The Prisma/libsql adapter has too much overhead in Vercel's cold-start environment. Current code has `/api/backup/export` endpoint (approach 4) that works conceptually but not within 30s. **Next session: rethink backup strategy from scratch** — consider Turso's own export tools, direct libsql client (bypass Prisma), Turso HTTP API from browser, GitHub Actions cron, or incremental table-by-table approach. |
| 2026-02-08 | **Browser-direct Turso backup session.** Implemented browser-direct backup/restore using `@libsql/client/web` to bypass Vercel's 30s timeout entirely. **Production export works** — browser queries Turso directly over HTTPS, 16 sequential SELECTs, JSON downloads. Architecture: (1) `GET /api/backup/credentials` returns Turso URL+token from env vars (404 in local dev). (2) `client/src/lib/backup.ts` — new module with `exportViaTurso()` and `importViaTurso()` using `@libsql/client/web`. (3) Settings page tries browser-direct first, falls back to server-side Prisma for local dev. (4) `POST /api/backup/import` server endpoint for local dev restore with `transformRecords()` for date/boolean conversion. (5) `POST /api/backup/save-local` to auto-save backup JSON to project `backups/` folder. (6) `backups/` added to `.gitignore`. Two bugs remained for next session. |
| 2026-02-08 | **Backup bug fixes session.** Fixed both remaining backup bugs: (1) **Date parsing** — `transformRecords()` now handles all three date formats from Turso: Unix millisecond timestamps (e.g. `1770157191736`), ISO strings with timezone (`"2026-02-06T16:18:17.954+00:00"`), and raw SQLite strings (`"2026-02-08 15:39:27"`). Extracted `toDate()` helper. Local restore from production backup now works. (2) **Save-local path** — replaced fragile `path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..', '..')` with robust project root detection that tries three candidate paths and verifies each contains `server/` and `client/` subdirectories. (3) **Backups folder** — created `backups/` directory with `.gitkeep` (contents gitignored). (4) **Save reminder UI** — amber banner appears on Settings page after backup download, reminding user to copy the JSON from Downloads into `SearchBook/backups/`. Production save-local silently fails (Vercel read-only filesystem), so manual copy is the workflow. |
| 2026-02-10 | **User feedback features session.** Three features: (1) **Data indicators on contact card tabs** — green dot indicators on Conversations, Relationships, and Prep Sheet tabs when data exists (`contact-detail.tsx`). (2) **Direct global search** — Ctrl+K and mobile search button now navigate directly to `/search` instead of opening command palette modal (`command-palette.tsx`, `layout.tsx`). (3) **Multi-select contacts/companies on actions** — added `ActionContact` and `ActionCompany` junction tables to Prisma schema; updated server `actions.ts` (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH) to handle `contactIds[]`/`companyIds[]` arrays; updated both client and server backup systems; converted `action-form.tsx` from single `Combobox` to `MultiCombobox`; updated `action-detail.tsx` and `action-list.tsx` to display multiple contacts/companies with legacy fallback. Backward compatible — existing single `contactId`/`companyId` fields preserved. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Quick Edit + Action Auto-create session.** (1) **Quick Status/Ecosystem changes** — implemented inline editing in Contact/Company list views and dropdown mechanism in detail page headers; optimistic UI updates. (2) **"Add Action" form enhancement** — enabled auto-creation of new contacts and companies directly from the form (new "Add [Name]" option in MultiCombobox). (3) **Navigation bug fix** — resolved issue where clicking status dropdowns in list view triggered row navigation; solution required wrapping dropdowns in a container with explicit `e.stopPropagation()`. All user feedback items from this session complete. |

All user feedback items from this session complete. |
| 2026-02-12 | Fixed multiple past companies bug (race condition) and single past company status bug. Applied fix for new company creation (omitting partial auto-save). **New Issues:** Deployment error reported by user; "People Discussed" in conversation log not creating new contacts. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Auto-save & Drafts session.** (1) **Default Sort** — contacts now sort by recent activity (updatedAt) by default. (2) **Auto-save Conversation Drafts** — implemented `localStorage` persistence for new conversation forms to prevent data loss; drafts restored synchronously on dialog open. (3) **Draft Visibility** — added "Resume Draft" indicator (amber button) to Conversation tab when a draft exists. (4) **Draft Discard** — "Cancel" button now explicitly clears the draft. (5) **Race Condition Fix** — fixed issue where opening dialog overwrote draft with empty state. |
| 2026-02-15 | **Prep Notes fix + Markdown expansion + Company Activity Log session.** (1) **Prep Notes CSS fix** — fixed bullet points not rendering in Prep Sheet tab; root cause was `prose prose-sm max-w-none` class (Tailwind Typography not installed) instead of custom `prep-note-markdown` CSS class. (2) **Markdown rendering expansion** — added `ReactMarkdown` + `prep-note-markdown` class to 6 additional display locations: contact research notes (2 places), conversation notes (list view + prep sheet), action description, and company notes. (3) **Company Activity Log** (new feature) — full-stack implementation: `CompanyActivity` Prisma model (id, companyId, date, type, title, notes), backend CRUD route (`/api/company-activities`), client `CompanyActivity` type + `COMPANY_ACTIVITY_TYPE_OPTIONS` (Applied/Email/Call/Meeting/Research/Follow Up/Other), Activity Log card on company detail page with expandable form (date picker, type selector, title, markdown notes) and badge-styled activity list with delete on hover. Turso production table created via direct libsql client. |
| 2026-02-16 | **Quick Action Due Date session.** (1) **Quick Date Change** — implemented `ActionDateSelect` component using `Popover` with presets (Today, Tomorrow, Next Week) and custom date picker. (2) **Dashboard & List Integration** — replaced static date text with interactive component in Dashboard rows and Action List table. (3) **Vercel Build Fixes** — resolved syntax errors, added missing `date-fns` dependency, fixed unused variable errors (strict mode), restored missing `ActionDateSelectProps` interface, and replaced `react-hot-toast` with `sonner` to match project standards. Feature fully deployed to production. |
| 2026-02-18 | **Bug fix session: conversation save + search stale results + edit mode drafts.** (1) **Bug: actions not saved in Log Conversation edit mode** — root cause: "Done" button called `setDialogOpen(false)` directly, skipping `handleSubmit()`; fixed by wiring Done button to `handleSubmit()`. (2) **Bug: stale UI after edit Done** — same root cause; `handleSubmit()` now calls `onRefresh()` after save, updating conversation cards. Also added `autoSave.cancel()` at start of `handleSubmit()` to prevent debounce-vs-PUT race condition. (3) **Bug: mobile search irrelevant results (stale responses)** — added `currentSearchRef` to discard API responses that arrive out of order; stale responses for shorter query terms no longer overwrite results for the final typed term. (4) **dueDate on conversation action cards** — added `dueDate: true` to `conversationIncludes.actions` server select. (5) **Edit mode draft UX (partially complete)** — changed edit dialog footer from "Revert + Done" to "Cancel + Done"; clicking 'x' saves form to localStorage and calls `onRefresh()`; `editDrafts` state (Set\<number\>) tracks which conversations have a pending draft and syncs from localStorage on `conversations` prop change. Amber "Resume Edit" indicator added to conversation cards. **REMAINING BUG (deferred):** After clicking 'x' to close edit dialog, the conversation card does not show the auto-saved content and the "Resume Edit" indicator does not appear. `onRefresh()` is called in `onOpenChange` but the effect does not behave as expected — root cause not yet determined. See NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT.md for full details. |
| 2026-02-18 | **Stale closure fix for edit-draft onOpenChange.** Root cause identified: `onOpenChange` inline arrow function captured `editId` and `form` from the React render closure. If Radix UI fired the callback while React had a pending-but-not-yet-committed render, the handler saw stale values — specifically `editId` could appear null, silently failing the `editId !== null` guard and skipping the entire draft-save + `onRefresh()` block. Fix: added `editIdRef` and `formRef` (both `useRef`) kept in sync via a no-dependency `useEffect` (runs after every committed render). `onOpenChange` now reads `editIdRef.current` and `formRef.current` instead of the closure variables, guaranteeing it always sees the most recently committed state. This resolves both symptoms: (a) "Resume Edit" amber badge now appears on the card after closing with 'x', and (b) the card refreshes to show the auto-saved server content. |
| 2026-02-23 | **Inline Action Saving session.** Implemented the ability to post follow-up actions to the `/api/actions` endpoint immediately from within the conversation modal, prior to submitting the conversation itself. Modified conversation routes (`POST /api/conversations` and `PUT /api/conversations/:id`) to accept an array of `linkActionIds` which links pre-saved inline actions to the newly created/edited conversation to maintain relational integrity. Added visual "Save Action" UI button and "✅ Saved" badge. |
| 2026-02-23 | **Resume Draft Bug Fix session.** Fixed an issue where the 'Resume Draft' button incorrectly stayed visible after successfully logging a new conversation. Added explicit state clears (`setHasDraft(false)` and `setForm(emptyForm)`) in `handleSubmit` to prevent the asynchronous `useEffect` from misinterpreting a populated form as an active draft. |
| 2026-02-23 | **Mobile Action Due Dates session.** Implemented the `ActionDateSelect` component natively into the mobile PWA view across the Dashboard, Action List, Contact Detail, Company Detail, and Global Search pages. Replaced static date text on desktop for Contact/Company Detail Action cards with interactive components. Resolved Vercel deployment TypeScript errors caused by typecasting (`ActionSearchResult` to `Action`) and unused variables. |

 | 2026-02-24 | **Delete Draft & Race Condition session.** (1) **Race Condition Fix** Prevented multiple orphaned drafts from being created during rapid typing by introducing a `useRef` lock (`draftGeneratedRef`) on the `newDraftId` generation sequence. (2) **Delete Draft Button** Added an explicit "Delete Draft" button to the New Contact form when loaded with a `draftId` parameter, which successfully purges the corresponding <draft_new_contact_> entry from `localStorage`. |
| 2026-02-24 | **Analytics Page Enhancements session.** Completely overhauled the Analytics page to support exact custom date ranges natively. (1) **Schema Additions**: Created `ContactStatusHistory` and `CompanyStatusHistory` schemas + injected initial DDL cleanly onto Turso cloud DB to begin precise logging of transition metrics. (2) **Robust APIs**: Refactored backend `/overview` to support total counters and rolling Recharts Sparklines, and created specific complex REST endpoints (`/contacts-metrics`, `/conversations-metrics`, etc) crunching transition aggregations via MIN subselects. (3) **UI Updates**: Replaced weak pie charts with extremely deep Grouped & Stacked horizontal BarCharts. Built in a React Day Picker header bound to date-fns arrays to sync all charts instantly per day. (4) **Production Clean Up**: Resolved Vercel deployment blocker specific to TS1484 `type-only` requirements, and stripped out a momentarily exposed dev migrating token entirely from git history using a forced reset. |
| 2026-02-25 | **Analytics Page Refinements session.** Addressed UI visual cleanup requests. (1) **Sparkline Tooltips** fixed the "Invalid Date" index loop by applying a `<XAxis dataKey="date" hide />` property directly alongside the lines. (2) **Company Discussions summary** mounted a new numeric `<Card>` using injected backend `inDiscussionsCompaniesCount` props to rapidly track priority companies. (3) **Point Indicators** manually wired a custom SVG `<g>` wrapper within Recharts dots to permanently label the zero-index origin point. (4) **BarChart Drill-down Data Pipeline** captured individual Bar clicks across Contacts Activity chart natively, passing dates to a new `/analytics/drilldown/contact-transitions` backend endpoint returning actual joined User profiles to a display `<Dialog>` popup with `/contacts/:id` fast-links. (5) **Vercel Build Fixes** solved Recharts onClick signature TS error blocking Vercel builds via `any` wrapper, and replaced unsupported `wouter` links structurally. |
| 2026-02-25 | **Analytics Page Interactive Charts session.** (1) **Drill-down API Endpoints:** Added `/drilldown/contacts`, `/drilldown/conversations`, `/drilldown/companies`, and `/drilldown/actions` REST endpoints to the analytics routes to support detailed data fetching for all metrics. (2) **Interactive Bar Charts:** Wired up `onClick` handlers to all Recharts `<Bar>` components to trigger a detailed drill-down dialog displaying the exact underlying data (including name, type, and summary for conversations). (3) **Sparkline Visibility Fix:** Added internal exact pixel `margin` constraints to the custom sparkline `LineChart` wrappers to prevent the first-point labels from clipping on the outer SVG bounds. (4) **Overview Cards Layout:** Squeezed the grid layout gap sizing for the top row cards from `gap-4` to `gap-2` to guarantee all 5 metric cards fit cleanly onto a single horizontal row for standard desktop viewports. |
